For an example in one-on-one game the starter is decided by raffling and the winner of the raffle decides which one starts, and the next round is started by other team/contestant. When there are multiple teams playing together, all the teams start on their own turn.\nIn the case of points being even, the placement is decided by:\n    1. Mutual matches\n    2. The rounds of mutual matches\n    3. Little points of mutual matches\n    4. All rounds of all matches\n    5. Little points of all matches\n    6. Raffle\n\nIn the case of points being even, the draw can be settled by Mölkuti (quick game deciding the winner). When comparing the rounds and the little points, first comes the subtraction of the points at issue, then the amounts.\nMölkky Organisation preserves the right to interpret and change these given rules.\n"

Versions:

    - expo 3.11.7

Initializing:
    
    Start by installing Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/
    
    Next install expo by opening Visual Studio Codes terminal, and typing 
    "npm install -g expo-cli"
    
    Go to the folder where you want to start building the app, and type to 
    terminal "expo init *project name here*"
    
    If it throws an error, go to C:/Users/User/AppData/Roaming/npm and remove 
    expo.ps1 and expo-cli.ps1 from the folder.
    
    Next go to the created app's folder and type "npm start" or "expo start".
    
    Now if you have Android phone connected to your computer, you can simply 
    press "Run on Android device/emulator" in the browser, and it will 
    automatically install Expo into your phone. If you open the app, 
    you can scan the QR-code appearing on your screen to build the app.
